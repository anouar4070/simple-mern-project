# After cloning this project, follow these steps to get up and running:

1- Install dependencies for each folder frontend & backend: <strong> npm install </strong>

2- Start the backend server in the first terminal window : <strong> cd backend/ </strong><strong> nodemon </strong>

3- Run the frontend in the second terminal window:   <strong> cd frontend/ </strong><br><strong> npm start  </strong>

This will launch the React application and allow you to interact with it in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000 by default).
